Overview
--------

The **Smart Package Manager** project has the ambitious objective of
creating smart and portable algorithms for solving adequately the
problem of managing software upgrading and installation. This tool
works in all major distributions, and will bring notable advantages
over native tools currently in use (APT, APT-RPM, YUM, URPMI, etc).

From `The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing`::

    smart

        1. <programming> Said of a program that does the {Right Thing}
        in a wide variety of complicated circumstances. (...)

Features

Modular
-------

Smart has been developed with modularity and flexibility in mind. It's
completely backend-based, and package-manager-agnostic. Support is
currently implemented for **RPM**, **DPKG**, and **Slackware**
package management systems, and porting it to new systems should be
very easy.


Smart Transactions
------------------

That's one of the most interesting aspects of Smart Package Manager,
and the one who has motivated calling it `smart`. Computing
transactions respecting the relations involved in the package
management world may become an unpleasant task when thousands of
packages and relations are being considered, or even when just
a few complex relations turn the most obvious choice into the
unwanted one.

While other softwares try to find a possible solution to satisfy
the relations involved in some user-requested operation, and
sometimes even fail to do so [1]_, Smart goes beyond it. In the
kernel of Smart Package Manager lives an algorithm that will
not only find a solution, if one is available, but will find
the best solution. This is done by quickly weighting every
possible solution with a pluggable policy, which redefines
the term "best" depending on the operation goal (install,
remove, upgrade, etc).

This behavior has many interesting consequences. In upgrades,
for instance, while precedence is given to newer versions,
intermediate versions may get selected if they result in a
better global result for the system. Packages may even be
reinstalled, if different packages with the same name-version
pair have different relations, and the one not installed
is a considered better option.

Another important goal achieved with the transaction algorithm
is that, even though it is able to check and fix relations in
the whole system, it will work even when there are broken
relations in installed packages. Only relations related to
the operation being made is checked for correctness.

.. [1] Check `Study Cases`_ for real cases where the algorithm
       works better than what is implemented in other softwares.

Multiple Interfaces
-------------------

Smart has multiple native and completely integrated interfaces:

- Command line interface, with several useful subcommands: update,
  install, reinstall, upgrade, remove, check, fix, download, search,
  and more.

- Shell interface, with command and argument completion, making it
  easy to perform multiple operations quickly using a local or
  remote terminal.

- Graphic interface, offering the friendliness of visual
  user interaction.

- Command line interface with graphic feedback, allowing one to
  integrate the power of command line with graphic environments.

Besides these interfaces, ksmarttray is also included in the smart
package. It notifies users about available updates using a KDE
tray icon.

Channels
--------

Channels are the way Smart becomes aware about external repositories
of information. Many different channel types are supported, depending
on the backend and kind of information desired:

- APT-DEB Repository
- APT-RPM Repository
- DPKG Installed Packages
- Mirror Information
- Red Carpet Channel
- RPM Directory
- RPM Header List
- RPM MetaData (YUM)
- RPM Installed Packages
- Slackware Repository
- Slackware Installed Packages
- URPMI Repository

Priority Handling
-----------------

Priorities are a powerful way to easily handle integration
of multiple channels and explicit user setups regarding
preferred package versions.

Basically, packages with higher priorities are considered a
better option to be installed in the system, even when package
versions state otherwise. Priorities may be individually
assigned to all packages in given channels, to all packages
with given names, and to packages with given names inside
given channels.

With custom priority setups, it becomes possible to avoid
unwanted upgrades, force downgrades, select packages in given
channels as preferential, and other kinds of interesting setups.

Autobalancing Mirror System
---------------------------

Smart offers a very flexible mirror support. Mirrors are URLs
that supposedly provide the same contents as are available in
other URLs, named origins. There is no internal restriction on
the kind of information which is mirrored. Once an origin URL
is provided, and one or more mirror URLs are provided, these
mirrors will be considered for any file which is going to be
fetched from an URL starting with the origin URL.

Mirror precedence is dynamically computed based on the history
of downloads of all mirrors available for a given origin URL
(including the origin site itself). The fastest mirrors and
with less errors are chosen. When errors occur, the next
mirror in the queue is tried.

For instance, if a mirror `http://mirror.url/path/` is provided
for the origin `ftp://origin.url/other/path/`, and a file in
`ftp://origin.url/other/path/subpath/somefile` is going to be
fetched, the mirror will be considered for being used, and the
URL `http://mirror.url/path/subpath/somefile` will be used if
the mirror is chosen. Notice that strings are compared and
replaced without any pre-processing, so that it's possible to
use different schemes (ftp, http, etc) in mirror entries, and
even URLs ending in prefixes of directory entries.

Downloading Mechanism
---------------------

Smart has a fast parallel downloading mechanism, allowing multiple
connections to be used for one or more sites. The mechanism
supports:

- Resuming
- Timestamp checking
- Parallel uncompression
- Autodetection of FTP user limit
- Cached file validation

and more.

At that moment, the following schemes are nativelly supported:

- file
- ftp
- http
- https
- scp

Additionally, the following schemes are supported when pycurl is
available:

- ftps
- telnet
- dict
- ldap
