Features
--------

Cache system:

- Recognizes multiple versions of the same package name.
- Package names decoupled from the upgrade procedure. Only
  thing that matter is obsoletes relations, which may be
  introduced implicitly by the loader system, if necessary.

Dependency solving algorithm:

- Very fast.
- Works by computing weights for different alternatives.
- Different notions of weight implemented by separate policies.
- Every available package is a candidate for dependency resolution.
- Algorithm is smart enough to even reinstall a package if two
  different packages with same name-version have different
  relations.
- Upgrades select the best option, not the latest available version.
