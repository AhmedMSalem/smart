- Ordering system
- Removable media handling
- Support extra flags for rpm backend package manager (equivalent
  to --replacefiles).
- Disable some checks in rpm backend package manager after
  considering it stable (allowing package replacing, temporary
  unsatisfied requires due to transaction breaking, etc).
- Introduce support for reinstall in install command, rpm pm,
  and report system.
- Make Package.coexists() handle every case of multi-version
  conflict, so that we don't need to introduce explicit
  conflicts in packages, and may change the configuration
  without reloading the cache.
- Priority handling.
