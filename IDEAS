Transaction system
------------------

- Support transaction diffing.

Commands
--------

- Introduce 'fix' command.
- Introduce a mixed-mode command, allowing to install/remove/upgrade.

Downloading and committing
--------------------------

- The committer may choose to install packages in chunks (cdroms,
  for early usage of packages, for getting security upgrades
  installed quickly, etc).
- May have multiple frontends (graphical/interactive, command line/one
  shot, etc).

RPM coloring
------------

<jbj> color of a package is union of file colors within.
<jbj> color of a dependency is union of file colors that have the dependency.
<jbj> color of a transaction is union of package colors.
<jbj> %_transaction_color is affinity mask.
<jbj> technically color=1 upgrades color=1, color=2 upgrades color=2. different
      arch is incidental.
<jbj> and color for file maps eaxctly to elf32/elf64 magic in file.
<jbj> dependency color is computed, not stored. there are arrays to attch
      variable number of dependencies to files, gory but straightforward.
<jbj> so starting pt and count saved for each file, depends dict contains 'P'
      or 'R' in 0xff000000 iirc, to determine whether index is into
      provides/requires, 0x00ffffff is index into {N,EVR,F} tag arrays.
<jbj> disjoint dependency graphs, each color is it's own graph, not too scary.
<jbj> the far more important issue is that files, not packages, have
      dependencies attached. that means a ppkg starts to become a lightweight
      container manifest rather than current heavyweight blob.
<jbj> btw, all the arrays are now sorted too, so bsearch becomes possible.
<jbj> hash still better, but rpm always been addicted to bsearch for uglix
      portability hysteria ;-)
<jbj> many-to-one is impossible map. one-to-many through filelist, see rpm -q
      --file{require,provide} 
<jbj> --filerequires displays only DEPENDSDICT(X,N) iff
      value & 0xff000000 == 'R'
<jbj> filedependsN is the number of deps starting at filedpendsX indexed
      through dependsdict that are attached to a file.

Package list sorting
--------------------

<jbj> niemeyer: just the voices in my head. ther is 1 degree of freedom for
tsort. FIFO/LIFO are perfectly ok, but the goal of ordering in an install is to
create as many leaf nodes as soon as possible, number of immediate descendants
in sub-tree is/was easy weight (because available in Knuth's tsort algorithm).
better weight is number of nodes in sub-tree, not just descendants. --chainsaw
seemed obvious thing to do
<jbj> heh, stare at mutisets, think about permutation groups and cycles.
multiply inherited dependencies (i.e. node has multiple possible "parents") is
then a forbidden permutation on the permutation group.
